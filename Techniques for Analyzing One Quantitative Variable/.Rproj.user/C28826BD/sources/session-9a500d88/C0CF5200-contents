## Introduction

- So far, we have learned about the research process in general in addition to some concepts in probability and hypothesis testing.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Now, how do we take those general ideas and apply them to real research questions?
    - As we have discussed, the specific tools and techniques we use to answer research questions depend largely in part on the type of variable or variables we are working with!
    
\vskip 0.10 in

- Let's first consider an example where we're working with a single quantitative variable coming from a single population.

## Introduction

- Suppose I am interested in TikTok usage among KSU undergraduate students. To understand how much students in this population use TikTok, I stood outside of the Student Center during lunchtime hours and asked 500 students how much they estimate they use TikTok per day (in hours). After conversations with people in that demographic, I hypothesize the mean amount of daily time spent using TikTok will be greater than 3 hours per day.

## Introduction

- Remember, the research process in general follows a systematic series of steps:

\vskip 0.10 in

1. Specify the Research Question
2. Specify the Research Hypothesis
3. Specify the Statistical Hypotheses
4. Collect Data
5. Perform Evidence Gathering Techniques
    a. Descriptive (data visualizations and quantitative summaries)
    b. Inferential (hypothesis tests and effect sizes)
6. Draw Contextual Conclusions

## Specify the Research Question

- All good research questions:
    1. Specify the population(s) of interest
    2. Specify the variable(s) to be analyzed
    3. Specify the characteristic of the variable(s) to be analyzed (e.g., mean)
    4. Generally specify the analytical method to be used
    
\vskip 0.10 in 

- In our example:
    1. KSU Undergraduate Students
    2. Daily Time (in hours) Spent on TikTok
    3. Mean Amount of Daily Time (in hours) Spent on TikTok
    4. Comparison
    
## Specify the Research Hypothesis

- In this case, the research hypothesis was explictly given to us:

\vskip 0.10 in

- "We hypothesize the mean amount of daily time spent using TikTok will be greater than 3 hours per day"

## Specify the Statistical Hypotheses

- Remember, the alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, maps to the research hypothesis which says the mean amount of time per day using TikTok will be greater than 3 hours. In mathematical symbols:

$$ H_A: \mu > 3 $$

- Then the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is just the opposite of the alternative:

$$ H_0: \mu \leq 3 $$

## Collect Data

- Wonderful! Now that we have gone through these steps, we can collect data and read them into RStudio. We can use either the import wizard or explicitly use the below code:

```{r}
library(readxl)
tiktok <- read_xlsx("TikTok Usage.xlsx")
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- One thing I am a huge proponent of is data visualization.

\vskip 0.10 in

- With it, we can take sometimes complicated data situations and present them in an accessible and aesthetically pleasing manner to convey meaning to broad audiences.

\vskip 0.10 in

- The type of visualization we have available to us is, you guessed it, dependent upon the type of variable we're working with (e.g., quantitative or categorical).

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- While there are numerous visualizations for a single quantitative variable, like what we have in this TikTok example, the most common and one of the most useful visualizations we have is called a \textit{histogram}.

\vskip 0.10 in

- A histogram is like a bar chart except for quantitative variables. What we do in constructing a histogram is to first take the total range of observed values from your quantitative variable (from smallest to largest) and split that range up into equally sized "bins". 

\vskip 0.10 in

- We then count up how many values fall within a given bin. We use the heights of the bars to represent those counts. How do we do this with R?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

\footnotesize
```{r,eval=F}
hist(tiktok$`Daily Time`,
     main="Daily Amount of KSU Undergrads Spend on TikTok",
     xlab="Hours Per Day",
     ylab="Frequency")
```
\normalsize


## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

```{r,echo=F}
hist(tiktok$`Daily Time`,
     main="Daily Amount of KSU Undergrads Spend on TikTok",
     xlab="Hours Per Day",
     ylab="Frequency")
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- Okay so this is well and good, but how do we interpret this visualization?

\vskip 0.10 in

- In general, I recommend answering the following questions:
    1. Where is/are the peak/peaks? (This tells us which range of values were most commonly observed)
    2. Is the histogram symmetric or skewed?
    3. What is the total range of observed values (what are the minimum and maximum observed values)?
    4. Are there any unusual characteristics or extreme values (i.e., "outliers")?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- Questions 1, 2, and 4 are fairly straightforward. But what do I mean by symmetric or skewed?

\vskip 0.10 in

- If we were to draw a vertical line through the middle of the histogram and fold the left side over onto the right side, we say we have \textbf{\underline{symmetry}} if the left-side roughly overlays the right-side.

\vskip 0.10 in

- If the left-side would not overlay the right-side, we say we have \textbf{\underline{skewness}}.
    - Note, the way we describe skewness follows the "tail". Let's look at a couple of examples to show what I mean:
    
## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

```{r,echo=F,include=T,fig.keep='first'}
sym <- rnorm(1000)
h1 <- hist(sym,main="Bell-Shaped & Symmetric",xlab="")
plot(h1)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

```{r,echo=F,include=T,fig.keep='first'}
uni <- runif(1000)
h2 <- hist(uni,main="Uniform & Symmetric",xlab="")
plot(h2)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

```{r,echo=F,include=T,fig.keep='first'}
pos <- rexp(1000)
h3 <- hist(pos,main="Positively or Right Skewed",xlab="")
plot(h3)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

```{r,echo=F,include=T,fig.keep='first'}
neg <- max(pos) - pos
h4 <- hist(neg,main="Negatively or Left Skewed",xlab="")
plot(h4)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- Okay, so circling back to our histogram for TikTok usage. I would say in our case:

\vskip 0.10 in

1. The peak is somewhere between 3 - 4.5 hours.
2. The histogram is approximately bell-shaped and symmetric.
3. Values range from 0.5 hours to 6.5 hours.
4. There isn't anything terribly unusual about this histogram except may I would have expected to observe some people who use TikTok for 0 hours and some who use it for 10 or more hours per day.

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Histograms

- Now, does the histogram provide support for the research hypothesis?

\vskip 0.10 in

- To answer this, we need to know approximately where the mean value lies on the histogram.

\vskip 0.10 in

- For symmetric histograms, it's in the middle. For left skewed, it's somewhat to the left of the peak. For right skewed, it's somewhat to the right of the peak.

\vskip 0.10 in

- In our case, since our histogram is symmetric, this means the mean is somewhere between 3 - 4.5 hours. So most of the peak is above 3 hours, which is what our research hypothesis is, so I'd say the histogram provides some modest support for the research hypothesis.

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- Of course, data visualizations are not the only descriptive evidence gathering technique. We can also calculate quantitative summaries of our quantitative variable!

\vskip 0.10 in

- The pieces of information we typically want to know about our quantitative variable are:
    1. What is a central/middle/typical value? (Measures of Central Tendency)
    2. How similar are the observations to one another? (Measures of Variability)
    3. How does one value relate to all of the other observations? (Measures of Position)
    
\vskip 0.10 in

- Let's start with the Measures of Central Tendency!

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- As mentioned, the Measures of Central Tendency let us know what a central or common value is among the data collected.

\vskip 0.10 in

- While there are several ways of measuring a central or common value, the two most prominently used measures are the \textbf{\underline{sample mean}} and \textbf{\underline{sample median}}.

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- We have all heard of a mean or average, right? We calculate it using the below formula:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i $$

- Less technically, we add up all of our values and divide by the total number of values observed ($n$).

\vskip 0.10 in

- But how do we interpret this value?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- Imagine if I put all 500 TikTok times on little slips of paper and then put them into a hat. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- I ask you to randomly pull a single slip of paper out of the hat and keep it enclosed in your palm. I then ask you to guess what you think the value on the slip of paper is.

\vskip 0.10 in

- The sample mean is your best guess as to what value is on the slip of paper.
    - How do we calculate this using R?
    
## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

```{r}
mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- So our best guess as to what a randomly selected TikTok time would be is `r round(mean(tiktok$"Daily Time"),2) ` hours.

\vskip 0.10 in

- What about the sample median? The sample median, also known as the 50th percentile, is the value where half (or 50\%) of the observed values are greater than it and half (or 50\%) of the observed values are less than it. Using R:

```{r}
median(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- The second piece of information we typically want to know about a quantitative variable is how similar all of the values are to one another.

\vskip 0.10 in

- We can think of this like throwing 10 darts at a dart board. If all of the darts land close together on the board, we'd conclude our throws were similar.
    - If all the darts land far apart (or even off the board!!), we'd conclude our throws were different.

\vskip 0.10 in

- In essence, what we're measuring in this case is variability! So how do we quantify variability when we're working with a quantitative variable? We have a couple of methods available to us!

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- The first measure is the \textbf{\underline{sample range}}, which you've likely heard of. Mathematically:

$$ \text{Range} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value} $$

- In R:

```{r}
max(tiktok$`Daily Time`) - min(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- But there are problems with relying on the range as the sole measure of variability. Why?

\vskip 0.10 in

1. It is an inefficient use of data (only looking at two values!)
2. It is not a standardized value (big values of the range or small values of the range don't necessarily imply more or less variability)
3. It is sensitive to outliers (makes sense! It uses the two values most likely to be outliers!)

\vskip 0.10 in

- So what else is out there?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- Instead, we typically use a measure called \textbf{\underline{standard deviation}}. What is standard deviation? Mathematically:

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2} $$

- Okay this may look a little intimidating. So what does it mean contextually?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- Remember the slips of paper in the hat? Suppose you randomly draw one again. This time, I ask you how far away from the sample mean you'd guess the value in your hand is (in either the positive or negative direction).

\vskip 0.10 in

- That's what standard deviation is: the expected distance an observation is away from its mean, in either the positive or negative direction.

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- The reasons why we like standard deviation are:

\vskip 0.10 in

1. $s > 0$, which means that bigger values imply more variability
2. It is in the original units being measured which helps us interpret the value more easily.

\vskip 0.10 in

- How do we calculate this in R?

```{r}
sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- The last question we typically have as it relates to quantitative summaries of a quantitative variable is: how does a specific value of our variable relate to all the others? 

\vskip 0.10 in

- In other words, what is its position?

\vskip 0.10 in

- Here we use a couple of measures:
    1. Z-Scores
    2. Quartiles (special cases of percentiles)
    
## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- A z-score is the number of standard deviations a particular value is away from its mean. Mathematically:

$$ Z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s} $$

- A z-score helps us know if our value, $x_i$, is typical (meaning $-2\leq z_i \leq 2$) or atypical (meaning either $z_i < -2$ or $z_i > 2$).
    - "Typical" values are relatively close to their mean. "Atypical" values are relatively far away from their mean.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Let's consider an example. Is a person who spends 2 hours per day considered typical or atypical? Let's calculate the z-score for 2 hours in R and find out!

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

```{r}
(2 - mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`))/sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

- Since $z=-1.60$, we would conclude that someone who spends 2 hours per day on TikTok is a typical user, at least in the context of this sample.

\vskip 0.10 in

- What about somebody who uses TikTok for 6 hours per day?

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

```{r}
(6 - mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`))/sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

- Since $z=2.48$, we would conclude that somebody who spends 6 hours per day on TikTok is an atypical user, at least in the context of this sample. 

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- The other measure of position we are generally interested in are the quartiles, of which there are three:

\vskip 0.10 in

1. Q1 or the 25th percentile
2. Q2 or the 50th percentile
3. Q3 or the 75th percentile

\vskip 0.10 in

- Remember, percentiles are the proportion of values less than our value of interest. Let's calculate these (and all of the other measures we've discussed so far besides z-scores) in R using the \texttt{rstatix} package.

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

```{r,eval=F}
install.packages('rstatix')
tiktok |>
  rstatix::get_summary_stats(`Daily Time`,type='full') |>
  dplyr::select(variable,mean,median,sd,q1,q3)
```
```{r,echo=F}
tiktok |>
  rstatix::get_summary_stats(`Daily Time`,type='full') |>
  dplyr::select(variable,mean,median,sd,q1,q3)
```

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

- Okay, so how do all of these values help us know if we have evidence for our research hypothesis??

\vskip 0.10 in

- First, since the sample mean and sample median are greater than 3 (which is what we hypothesized), this gives us evidence in support of the research hypothesis.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Second, since 3 hours is closer to $Q1 = 2.83$ than it is to $Q3$, this also gives us support for our hypothesis that KSU undergraduates use TikTok for more than 3 hours per day. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- Finally, we can calculate a z-score to see how similar our sample mean value is to our 3 hour threshold:

## Descriptive Evidence Gathering Techniques: Quantitative Summaries

```{r}
(mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`) - 3)/sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)
```

- This value tells us that maybe our sample mean value isn't so different from 3 hours. 

## Final Thoughts

- So in summary, the research hypothesis has some support, but it isn't entirely conclusive.

\vskip 0.10 in

- As a result, we need to use a hypothesis test to help us make a final conclusion.

\vskip 0.10 in

- This is what we will talk about in the next lecture!
