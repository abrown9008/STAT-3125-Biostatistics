## STAT 3125 - One Quantitative Variable Descriptive Analysis Techniques ##

## Step 1: Read in the Data ##

tiktok <- readxl::read_xlsx("Tiktok Usage.xlsx")

## Step 2: Generate and Interpret a Histogram ##

hist(tiktok$`Daily Time`,
     main="Daily Amount of KSU Undergrads Spend on TikTok",
     xlab="Hours Per Day",
     ylab="Frequency")

# 1. The peak is somewhere between 3 - 4.5 hours.
# 2. The histogram is approximately bell-shaped and symmetric.
# 3. Values range from 0.5 hours to 6.5 hours.
# 4. There isn't anything terribly unusual about this histogram 
# except maybe I would have expected to observe some people who use TikTok 
# for 0 hours and some who use it for 10 or more hours per day. ##

## Step 3: Calculate Sample Mean & Sample Median ##

## Sample Mean ##

mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`)

## Sample Median ##

median(tiktok$`Daily Time`)

## Step 4: Calculate Measures of Variation (Range & Standard Deviation) ##

## Range ##

max(tiktok$`Daily Time`) - min(tiktok$`Daily Time`)

## Standard Deviation ##

sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)

## Step 5: Create a table containing most of the above info along with
## quartiles ##

tiktok |>
  rstatix::get_summary_stats(`Daily Time`,type='full') |>
  dplyr::select(variable,mean,median,sd,q1,q3)

## Step 6: Create Z-Score for mean using 3 hours ##

(mean(tiktok$`Daily Time`) - 3)/sd(tiktok$`Daily Time`)

## The sample mean may not be terribly different from 3 hours ##
